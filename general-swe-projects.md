### 9. **Cloud Infrastructure as Code Tool**

- **Backend**: Go
- **Frontend**: HTMX + Tailwind CSS
- **Features**: Create a tool that allows developers to define cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure) using Go code or JSON/YAML. This will deploy and manage cloud resources programmatically.
- **Skills**: Infrastructure-as-code (IaC), working with cloud APIs (AWS, GCP), DevOps, and CI/CD pipelines.

### 10. **Distributed File Storage System**

- **Backend**: Go
- **Frontend**: HTMX + Tailwind CSS
- **Features**: Build a system like IPFS, where users can store and share files in a distributed, decentralized manner. Include version control and encryption.
- **Skills**: Distributed systems, consensus algorithms, file encryption, and database replication.
