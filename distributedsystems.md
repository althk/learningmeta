# Distributed Systems Project Ideas

If you're interested in understanding distributed systems at an infrastructure level, a good approach is to implement a classic distributed system design. Here are some options that can help you get hands-on experience with various distributed system concepts:

### 1. **Distributed Key-Value Store (e.g., Miniature Consistent-Hashing DHT)**

- **Concepts Covered**: Distributed hash tables, consistent hashing, node membership, fault tolerance, replication.
- **Implementation**: Create a distributed key-value store similar to Apache Cassandra or Amazon Dynamo. You can learn about consistent hashing to distribute data across nodes and implement fault-tolerant data replication.
- **Benefits**: This project introduces fundamental concepts like data partitioning, replication, and consistency.

### 2. **Distributed Task Queue (e.g., Miniature Celery)**

- **Concepts Covered**: Task distribution, load balancing, worker coordination, fault tolerance.
- **Implementation**: Implement a distributed task queue where clients push tasks, and distributed workers consume and execute them. You can add retries, message persistence, and a mechanism for dynamic worker scaling.
- **Benefits**: Teaches about work queue distribution, dynamic task assignment, and resilience through retry strategies.

### 3. **Raft Consensus Algorithm**

- **Concepts Covered**: Consensus, leader election, state replication.
- **Implementation**: Implement the **Raft consensus algorithm** to get a deep understanding of distributed coordination. Raft helps distributed systems achieve consensus (used in etcd, Consul).
- **Benefits**: This is an excellent way to learn about consensus protocols, leader election, and log replication.

### 4. **Distributed Logging System (Improved Version)**

- **Concepts Covered**: Event collection, log aggregation, durability, sharding, eventual consistency.
- **Implementation**: Build a more advanced version of your current logging service that can run across multiple nodes, aggregate logs, shard data for load balancing, and provide durability guarantees.
- **Benefits**: Provides experience with log aggregation, fault tolerance, and data partitioning.

### 5. **Leader Election System (Zookeeper-like)**

- **Concepts Covered**: Leader election, service coordination, watch/notify patterns.
- **Implementation**: Implement a system for leader election among distributed nodes, similar to how **Apache Zookeeper** operates. Nodes register themselves, and one is elected leader; when a failure occurs, the system elects a new leader.
- **Benefits**: You'll understand service discovery, failover, and cluster coordination.

### 6. **Distributed File System (e.g., Mini HDFS)**

- **Concepts Covered**: File sharding, replication, fault tolerance, high availability.
- **Implementation**: Create a distributed file system where files are split into chunks, distributed among nodes, and replicated for reliability. You could implement a master node that tracks metadata and several data nodes.
- **Benefits**: This helps you understand concepts like chunking, replication for fault tolerance, and metadata management.

### 7. **Peer-to-Peer Network (e.g., BitTorrent-like)**

- **Concepts Covered**: P2P protocols, swarming, data distribution, scalability.
- **Implementation**: Build a simplified version of a P2P file-sharing network. Allow peers to connect, share file metadata, and download parts of the file from other peers.
- **Benefits**: Teaches peer-to-peer communication, decentralized discovery, and scalable file sharing.

### 8. **Distributed Metrics Collection and Monitoring System**

- **Concepts Covered**: Distributed data collection, time series storage, consistency, durability.
- **Implementation**: Create a system similar to Prometheus. Collect metrics from distributed nodes and store them centrally, implement queries, and visualize time series data.
- **Benefits**: This project covers time series databases, distributed data gathering, and monitoring, which are critical components in understanding distributed system observability.

### Recommendation

If this is your first foray into building distributed systems:

- Start with the **Distributed Key-Value Store** or **Raft Consensus Algorithm** implementation. These projects are foundational and will help you understand consistency, replication, and leader electionâ€”core components of distributed systems.

If you have experience with some distributed components:

- Try a **Distributed Task Queue** or **Distributed File System**. These provide practical experience with load balancing, work distribution, sharding, and fault tolerance.
